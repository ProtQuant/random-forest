# random-forest
**stage two of the project -- feature elimination, finding the most important chemical features in deciding peptides' scores**

# rf_regressor6.py

* The code can be separated into two parts: data preprocessing and feature elimination

## Data Preprocessing

1. generate  and save`df_dataset`

   * Implemented by `generate_dataset` method

   * `df_dataset` is the data needed for training models. The method will merge peptides' scores and peptides' features.

   * parameters:

     ```python
     #  data loading options
     need_init_dataset = True
     need_init_score = True
     need_init_feature = True
     chunk_size = 50000  # for reading in feature_file
     
     #  input files
     score_file = '../input files/score.csv'
     feature_file = "../input files/all_dragon.txt"
     ```


     - If `need_init_dataset` is set to False, which means `df_dataset `has been made, and then all that need to be done is just load`df_dataset` from saved data.

       If `need_init_dataset` is set to be true, it will depends on the values of `need_init_score `and `need_init_feature` to decide whether to preprocess or to just load in the `df_s` and `df_f`.

   * If the code runs for the first time, set the three `need_` parameters to `True`.

   * Need to change `preprocess_scores` and `preprocess_features` methods if data format in `score_file` and `feature_file` changes.

     `score_file`:

     `feature_file`:

     â€‹	![image-20210920134729235](README.assets/image-20210920134729235.png)

   * Default file structure:

     ```
     - src
         - rf_regressor6.py
     - input
         - all dragon.txt (have uploaded to github)
         - score.csv (output of stage one of the project)
     - saved data (output)
         - rf_regressor6 
         	- df_s (have uploaded to )
         	- df_f
         	- df_dataset
     ```

2.  Will generate a picture (x = peptide_length, y = peptide_score) in `saved data/rf_refressor6` if setting `need_score_length_pic = True`

3. generate and save`X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`

   (test set is sorted by score)

   * Parameters

     ```python
     # The percentage of needed data to create training and testing sets
     data_portion = 0.01  # (0,1], set to 1 if using all the peptides
     
     # whether to save X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test 
     # id true, will save to 'saved data/rf_regressor6/rfe_(n_training samples)/data_dict
     save_dataset_dict = True
     ```

   

   ## Feature Elimination
